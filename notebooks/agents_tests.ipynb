Black -Box Testing •Black box testing, also called behavioral testing, focuses on the functional requirements of the software. •That is, black box testing enables the software engineer to derive sets of input conditions that will fully exercise all functional requirements for a program.  Black -Box Testing •Black box testing attempts to find errors in the following categories: - incorrect or missing functions - interface errors - errors in data structures or external database access - behavior or performance errors - initialization and termination errors  Advantage of Black -Box Testing •More effective on larger units of code than glass box testing. •Tester needs no knowledge of implementation, including specific programming languages. •Tester and programmer are independent of each other. •Tests are done from a user's point of view. •Will help to expose any ambiguities or inconsistencies in the specifications. •Test cases can be designed as soon as the specifications are complete.  Disadvantages of Black -Box Testing •Only a small number of possible inputs can actually be tested, to test every possible input stream would take nearly forever. •Without clear and concise specifications, test cases are hard to design. •There may be unnecessary repetition of test inputs if the tester is not informed of test cases the programmer has already tried.  Black -Box Testing Approaches •Analysis of the input/output domain of the program. •Analysis of the observable black -box behavior. •Techniques like risk analysis, random input, stress testing.  Test Case Design Technique : Black -Box •Deriving test cases directly from a requirement specification or black box test design technique. The Techniques include: - Equivalence Partitioning (EP) - Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) - Decision Table Testing - State Transition Diagrams - Use Case Testing  Equivalence Partitioning (EP) •Equivalence Partitioning (EP) also called as equivalence class partitioning (ECP) •It is a software testing technique that divides the input test data of the application under test into each partition at least once of equivalent data from which test cases can be derived •An advantage of this approach is it reduces the time required for performing testing of a software due to less number of test cases  Equivalence Partitioning (EP) – Example  If one application is accepting input range from  to , using equivalence class we can divide inputs into the classes for example, one for valid input and another for invalid input and design one test case from each class.  Equivalence Partitioning (EP) – Example  •One is for valid input class i.e. selects any value from input between ranges  to . •So here we are not writing hundreds of test cases for each value. •Any one value from this equivalence class should give you the same result. •One is for invalid data below lower limit i.e. any one value below . •One is for invalid data above upper limit i.e. any value above . Equivalence Partitioning (EP) – Example  •Consider percentage field that will accept percentage only between  to  %, more and even less than not be accepted, and application will redirect user to an error page. If percentage entered by user is less than  %or more than  %, that equivalence partitioning method will show an invalid percentage. If percentage entered is between  to  %, then equivalence partitioning method will show valid percentage. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/equivalence -partitioning -method/ Equivalence Partitioning (EP) – Example  23https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/equivalence -partitioning -method/ Boundary Value Analysis (BV A) •Boundary value analysis (BVA) is a type of black box or specification based testing technique in which tests are performed using the boundary values. •Boundary Testing comes after the Equivalence Class Partitioning. •Testing between extreme ends or boundaries between partitions of the input values. Boundary Value Analysis (BV A) - Example •Input data  to  (boundary value) •Test input data , ,  to , ,  Decision Table Testing •A decision table is a good way to deal with combinations of Inputs. •Also referred as cause - effect table. •Focused on business logic or business rules. •Decision tables provide a systematic way of stating complex business rules. Decision Table Testing •Number of possible Combinations is given by  ^ n , where n is the number of Inputs. •In the above example : - we would need  ^  =  combinations. Advantages of Decision Table Testing •It provide complete coverage of test cases which help to reduce the rework on writing test scenarios & test cases. •Any complex business flow can be easily converted into the test scenarios & test cases using this technique. •Simple to understand and everyone can use this method design the test scenarios & test cases. •These tables guarantee that we consider every possible combination of condition values. This is known as its “ completeness property ”. State Transition Diagrams •A state transition model has four basic parts: - The states that the software may occupy (open/closed or funded/insufficient funds). - The transitions from one state to another (not all transitions are allowed). - The events that cause a transition (closing a file or withdrawing money) - The actions that result from a transition (an error message or being given your cash) State Transition Diagrams 30shows an example of entering a Personal Identity Number (PIN) to a bank account. State Transition Diagrams 31https://www.guru99.com/software -testing -techniques.html (Thomas Hamilton) State Transition Table 32https://www.guru99.com/software -testing -techniques.html (Thomas Hamilton) Use Case Testing •Use Case Testing is a software testing technique that helps to identify test cases that cover entire system on a transaction by transaction basis from start to end. •Test cases are the interactions between users and software application. •Use case testing helps to identify gaps in software application that might not be found by testing individual software components. Use Case Testing •A Use Case in Testing is a brief description of a particular use of the software application by an actor or user. •Use cases are made on the basis of user actions and the response of the software application to those user actions. •It is widely used in developing test cases at system or acceptance level. Use Case Testing - Example  https://www.guru99.com/use -case -testing.html (Thomas Hamilton) Use Case Testing - Example  https://www.guru99.com/use -case -testing.html (Thomas Hamilton) White -Box Testing •Focus: Thoroughness (Coverage). Every statement in the component is executed at least once. •White box testing is also known as structural testing or code based testing. •The major objective of white box testing is to focus in internal program structure, and discover all internal program errors.  Advantage of White -Box Testing •Helps optimizing the code and removing extra line of code. •All possible code pathways can be tested including error handling, resource dependencies, & additional internal code logic/flow. •Enables tester to find programming errors quickly . •Good quality of coding work and coding standards.  Disadvantage of White -Box Testing •Knowledge of code & internal structure is a prerequisite , a skilled tester is needed to carry out this type of testing, which increase the cost. •Impossible to look into every bit of code to find out hidden errors. •Very expensive technique . •Requires knowledge of target system, testing tools and coding language . •Requires specialized tools such as source code analyzer, debugger, and fault injectors  Test Case Design Technique : White -Box •Structural - test case selection is based on an analysis of the internal structure of component - Statement Coverage - Branch Coverage - Condition Coverage - Path coverage Statement Coverage •Statement coverage methodology: design test cases so that every statement in a program is executed at least once. •The principal idea: unless a statement is executed, we have no way of knowing if an error exists in that statement. By choosing the test set {(x=,y=),(x=,y=), (x=,y=)} all statements are executed at least once. Branch Coverage •Test cases are designed such that: different branch conditions given true and false values in turn. •Branch testing guarantees statement coverage : a stronger testing compared to the statement coverage based testing. Test cases for branch coverage can be: {(x=,y=),(x=,y=), (x=,y=), (x=,y=)} Condition Coverage •Test cases are designed such that: each component of a composite conditional expression given both true and false values. No condition to coverIn order to cover all conditions, you need  test cases. Path Coverage •In this the test case is executed in such a way that every path is executed at least once. •All possible control paths taken, including all loop paths taken zero, once, and multiple (ideally, maximum) items in path coverage technique, the test cases are prepared based on the logical complexity measure of a procedural design.

Unit Test •Concerned with functional correctness and completeness of individual program units. •Typically written and run by software developers to ensure that code meets its design and behaves as intended. •Its goal is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct.  What is Unit Testing •Concerned with - Functional correctness and completeness. - Error handling. - Checking input values (parameter). - Correctness of output data (return values). -Optimizing algorithm and performance .  Types of Testing •Black Box Testing : application interface, internal module interface and input/output description. •White Box Testing : function executed and checked. •Gray Box Testing : test cases, risks assessments and test methods .  Types of Testing  Why Unit Test? •Faster Debugging . •Faster Development . •Better Design. •Excellent Regression Tool. •Reduce Future Cost.  https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html Benefits •Unit testing allows the programmer to refactor code at a later date, and make sure the module still works correctly. •By testing the parts of a program first and then testing the sum of its parts, integration testing becomes much easier. •Unit testing provides a sort of living documentation of the system.  A good unit test •Isolated/independent - Test one thing at a time. - Unit under test doesn’t depend on the other to make test runs. •Repeatable - Running multiple times yields the same result. - Doesn’t rely on environment. •Fast - You want to repeat it again and again. - You want it to be a pleasure to work with. •Self -Documenting - Test code and code under test clear and concise. - Can be a reference for usage of your class/method/etc.  Workshop Test Case Design •Requirements - Can create bank accounts. - Can deposit money into account. - Can withdraw money from account (Throw exception if balance is insufficient). - Can transfer money from one account to another.

In performance testing, we are primarily focused on speed, whereas functional testing is concerned with correctness of the application behavior. •Although performance tests are a part of the continuous build cycle along with the functional tests, the results of performance testing should be interpreted only after the application passes the functional tests.Performance Testing  •To confirm and validate the specified system performance requirements. •To check the current product capacity to answer the questions from customers and marketing people. •To identify performance issues and performance degradation in a given system.Objectives of Performance Testing  •Scalability : Will the application handle the expected load and beyond? •Stability : Is the application stable under expected and unexpected user loads? •Availability : Is the application available to the end user without any interruption?Why Performance Testing?  •Serviceability : Can the system quickly recover from a Failure? •Speed : Does the application respond quickly. •Confidence : Are you sure that clients will have a positive experience on go live day?Why Performance Testing?  •The time taken by the application to respond to the user’s request is called the response time. •It is measured in seconds or milliseconds as appropriate for the application. •Every application should strive to minimize the response time.Response Time  Response Time  Reference : Pro Apache JMeter Web Application Performance Testing ( Apress ) Sai Matam and Jagdeep Jain •A sequence of request/responses constitutes a transaction. •The number of transactions per unit time is called the throughput. •It is measured in transactions/second or bandwidth (bytes/second). •It depends on server hardware, system load, and network latency. •The application should strive to maximize the throughput.Throughput  •Load Test - Load Testing help us to study the behavior of the application under various loads. - The main parameter to focus is response time. - This study reveals how the application handles concurrent users effectively.Types of Performance Tests  •Stress Test - Stress Testing help us to observe the stability of the application. - The main intention is to identify the breaking point of the server. - The main parameter to focus is throughput (how much data is being transferred between client and server)Types of Performance Tests  •Other Performance Test - Endurance Test : It is performed to ensure the software can handle the expected load over a long period. - Spike Test It tests the product’s reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.Types of Performance Tests  Reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/performance -testing -software -testing/ •Other Performance Test - Volume testing : In volume testing, large number of data is saved in a database and the overall software system’s behaviour is observed. The objective is to check the product’s performance under varying database volumes.Types of Performance Tests  Reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/performance -testing -software -testing/ •Other Performance Test - Scalability testing : In scalability testing, the software application’s effectiveness is determined by scaling up to support an increase in user load. It helps in planning capacity additions to your software system.Types of Performance Tests  Reference : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/performance -testing -software -testing/ •JMeter is a software that can perform load test, performance -oriented business (functional) test, regression test, etc., on different protocols or technologies.Performance Test Tool  •Being an open source software, it is freely available. •It has a simple and intuitive GUI. •JMeter can conduct load and performance test for many different server types − Web - HTTP, HTTPS, SOAP, Database via JDBC, LDAP, JMS, Mail - POP3, etc. •It is a platform -independent tool. •It can also be used to perform automated and functional testing of the applications.JMeter Features  Reference : https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ Installing JMeter •Java Installation.

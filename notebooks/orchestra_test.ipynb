Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model is a simplified representation of a “Software Development Process Models”. ●SDLC is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process. ●The roadmap to building high quality software products is software process. ●Different life cycle models may plan the necessary development activities to phases in different ways.  ●Following are the most important and popular SDLC models followed in the industry ○Waterfall Model ○V-Modell ○Spiral Model ○Iterative Mode Other related methodologies are Agile Model, Incremental Model, Rapid Application Development Model (RAD) Model, and Prototyping Models.  Requirements Analysis and Specification •Consultation •System users/Customer System and software design •System architecture •UXUI Implementation and unit testing •Programmer Integration and system testing •Tester Operation and maintenance •Support team Waterfall Model     “The following phase should not be start until the previous phase has finished”  The aim of the requirement analysis and specification phase is to understand the exact requirements of the customer and document them properly. This phase consists of two different activities. Requirements Analysis and Specification Waterfall Model  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-classical-waterfall-m odel/ . Requirement gathering and analysis: Firstly all the requirements regarding the software are gathered from the customer and then the gathered requirements are analyzed. . Requirement specification: These analyzed requirements are documented in a software requirement specification (SRS) document. SRS document serves as a contract between development team and customers .  Why do we need user research? Customer insights Function Priority Usability Understand what Problems customers want solved Analyze how important These problems are to customersWhat products and features we can develop to solve these problems R esource from S lideshare :: J oan Lumanauw SurveysInterviewsFocus Group  The aim of the design phase is to transform the requirements specified in the SRS document into a structure that is suitable for implementation in some programming language. It defines the overall software architecture together with high level and detailed design. All this work is documented as a Software Design Document (SDD). System and software design Waterfall Model  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-classical-waterfall-m odel/ ● Plan the programming language, for Example Java , PHP , ASP .net ● or database like Oracle, MySQL, etc. ● Or other high-level technical details of the project Example:  This phase aims to transform the requirements gathered in the SRS into a suitable form which permits further coding in a programming language. With inputs from the system design, the system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is referred to as Unit Testing. Implementation and unit testing Waterfall Model  Input x Function f() Output y Unit Testing  All the units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures. System testing consists three diﬀerent kinds of testing activities as described below :Integration and system testing Waterfall Model  ●Alpha testing: Alpha testing is the system testing performed by the development team. ●Beta testing: Beta testing is the system testing performed by a friendly set of customers. ●Acceptance testing: After the software has been delivered, the customer performed the acceptance testing to determine whether to accept the delivered software or to reject it. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-classical-waterfall-m od e l/  Maintenance is the most important phase of a software life cycle. The effort spent on maintenance is the % of the total effort spent to develop a full software. There are some issues which come up in the client environment. To fix those issues, patches are released. Also to enhance the product some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment. Operation and maintenance Waterfall Model  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-engineering-classical-waterfall-m odel/  Verification and validation are the processes of confirming that systems engineering artifacts generated during the transformation processes are acceptable J ournal R eference by M ike Ryan and Louis S Wheatcraft On the U se of the T erms V eriﬁcation and V alidation : J u ly 2017I NC O S E I nternational Symposium ():- V Model  Verification and Validation and the Systems Engineering \" V \" Model V Model J ournal R eference by M ike Ryan and Louis S Wheatcraft On the U se of the T erms V eriﬁcation and V alidation : J u ly 2017I NC O S E I nternational Symposium ():- Stakeholder Requirements System Requirements System Integration Verification Development Unit/Component Requirements Subsystem Requirements Acceptance/Operational Evaluation and Validation Subsystem Integration Verification Unit/Component Verification Stakeholder Needs PRODUCT Requirement & Design Verification & Validation System Integration, Verification, & Validation Requirement & Development, Decomposition, Definition, & Design Concept Development Design Production Operations Product Lifecycle  Requirement Engineering  What is requirements engineering?  ●Requirement engineering is usually the first step in any software development life cycle ●The process to gather the software requirements from client, analyze and document them is known as requirement engineering. ●The goal of requirement engineering is to create and maintain detailed ‘System Requirements Specification' documents.
